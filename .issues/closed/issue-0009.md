# Issue 0009: Document environment variables

## Problem to be solved
Users and developers need clear documentation about environment variables that can be used to configure the application. Currently, these variables are only documented in code comments or not at all. This makes it difficult for users to understand how to properly configure the tool for different environments and use cases.


## Planned approach
Create a dedicated documentation file for environment variables, with clear explanations of each variable's purpose, format, and default value. Include example use cases to show how these variables can be used in different scenarios. Also add a brief summary in the README with a link to the detailed documentation.
