## Planned approach
Create tool wrappers for key issue-cards commands and implement proper output parsing

## Failed approaches


## Questions to resolve


## Tasks
- [ ] Write failing unit tests for the functionality
- [ ] Run the unit tests and verify they fail for the expected reason
- [ ] Design MCP tool interface and registration system
- [ ] Run unit tests and verify they now pass
- [ ] Make sure test coverage meets project requirements
- [ ] Implement mcp__listIssues tool
- [ ] Implement mcp__showIssue tool
- [ ] Implement mcp__getCurrentTask tool
- [ ] Implement mcp__addTask tool
- [ ] Create common error handling for all tools
- [ ] Add parameter validation with JSON schema
- [ ] Write failing end-to-end test that verifies the expected behavior
- [ ] Run the test and verify it fails correctly
- [ ] {{TASK}}
- [ ] Run the end-to-end test and verify it passes
- [ ] Verify the feature works in the full application context
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for core tools

## Instructions
Follow a consistent pattern for all tool implementations. Ensure proper error handling and clear error messages.
