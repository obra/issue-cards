# Issue 0017: Update README and cross-references

## Problem to be solved
The README contains duplicated documentation, and cross-references between documentation sections are inconsistent.

## Planned approach
Update the README to focus on high-level overview and link to the new documentation system. Ensure consistent cross-referencing throughout documentation.

## Failed approaches


## Questions to resolve


## Tasks
- [ ] Revise README to remove duplicated command details
- [ ] Add information about the new help system in README
- [ ] Update links in README to point to new documentation structure
- [ ] Ensure consistent cross-references between documentation files
- [ ] Add &#x27;related topics&#x27; sections to documentation files

## Instructions
The README should serve as an entry point that explains what issue-cards is and how to get started, but it should defer to the help system for detailed documentation. Ensure all cross-references use relative paths correctly.
