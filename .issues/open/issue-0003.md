# Issue 0003: Implement MCP Tool Output Capturing

## Problem to be solved
We need a way to capture command output that normally goes to the console for use in MCP tools

## Planned approach
Create a utility to intercept output manager calls and return structured data

## Failed approaches


## Questions to resolve


## Tasks
- [ ] Write failing unit tests for the functionality
- [ ] Run the unit tests and verify they fail for the expected reason
- [ ] Write unit tests for output capturing utility
- [ ] Run unit tests and verify they now pass
- [ ] Make sure test coverage meets project requirements
- [ ] Implement output capturing utility
- [ ] Create helper functions to parse captured output into structured data
- [ ] Write adapters for common command patterns
- [ ] Add utility to restore original output handlers
- [ ] Update output manager to support silent mode
- [ ] Write failing end-to-end test that verifies the expected behavior
- [ ] Run the test and verify it fails correctly
- [ ] {{TASK}}
- [ ] Run the end-to-end test and verify it passes
- [ ] Verify the feature works in the full application context
- [ ] Write integration tests for output capturing with real commands

## Instructions
Ensure all output manager methods are properly intercepted. Maintain proper error handling throughout.
