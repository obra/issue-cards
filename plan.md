# Issue Cards Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step process for building the Issue Cards tool using Node.js, Commander.js, Unified/Remark, Handlebars, npm, ESLint, and Prettier. The implementation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## TDD Approach

Each feature in this plan follows a consistent TDD workflow:

1. **Write Failing Tests**: Create tests that define the expected behavior before implementing any code
2. **Implement Minimal Code**: Write just enough code to make the tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping tests passing
4. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle for each new feature or enhancement
