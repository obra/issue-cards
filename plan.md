# Issue Cards Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the step-by-step process for building the Issue Cards tool using Node.js, Commander.js, Unified/Remark, Handlebars, npm, ESLint, and Prettier. The implementation follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.

## TDD Approach

Each feature in this plan follows a consistent TDD workflow:

1. **Write Failing Tests**: Create tests that define the expected behavior before implementing any code
2. **Implement Minimal Code**: Write just enough code to make the tests pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping tests passing
4. **Repeat**: Continue this cycle for each new feature or enhancement

### Command Verbosity
- Consider shorter command names for better usability
- `complete-task` → `complete`
- `add-task` → `add`
- `add-question` → `question`
- `log-failure` → `failure`

### Smart Defaults
- Add defaults for empty sections in issue creation
- Auto-generate timestamp for issue creation
- Provide sensible default placeholders for template fields
- Auto-format multi-line inputs without requiring specific formatting flags

### Template Discovery
- Add template preview functionality to see template structure before using

- Add a command to show template examples with real data
- Implement interactive template selection

### Inline Editing
- Add ability to edit issues without directly modifying the markdown
- Create commands for updating specific issue sections
- Add command to add/edit tasks without needing to edit the file
