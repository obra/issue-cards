# Issue 0012: Implement Command Aliases

## Problem to be solved
The CLI interface has lengthy command names that can be tedious to type repeatedly. Adding shorter aliases for common commands would improve developer experience and productivity.

## Planned approach
Implement aliases for frequently used commands using Commander.js's alias feature. Update documentation to reflect these aliases.

## Failed approaches

## Questions to resolve

## Tasks
- [x] Add 'complete' alias for the 'complete-task' command
- [x] Add 'add' alias for the 'add-task' command
- [x] Add 'question' alias for the 'add-question' command
- [x] Add 'failure' alias for the 'log-failure' command
- [x] Write unit tests to verify that aliases are correctly defined
- [x] Write E2E tests to verify that aliases work at the CLI level
- [x] Update README.md with examples of alias usage
- [x] Update commands.md to document all aliases

## Instructions
Keep the changes simple and focused. Use the Commander.js alias() method to add aliases. Make sure all tests pass.

## Next steps
Consider adding alias support for the MCP API endpoints to maintain consistency between the CLI and API.
