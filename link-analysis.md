# Documentation Link Analysis

## Broken Links Summary

Our link validator discovered the following issues that need to be fixed:

### File Path Issues

1. **Path relativity errors**:
   - Many links in `docs/guides/getting-started.md` use incorrect relative paths:
     - `tutorials/basic-workflow.md` should be `../tutorials/basic-workflow.md`
     - `guides/git-integration.md` should be `git-integration.md` or `./git-integration.md`
     - `reference/environment-vars.md` should be `../reference/environment-vars.md`
     - `tutorials/index.md` should be `../tutorials/index.md`
     - `guides/index.md` should be `./index.md` or `index.md`
     - `reference/index.md` should be `../reference/index.md`
     - `design/index.md` should be `../design/index.md`

2. **Missing or moved files**:
   - `../getting-started.md` is referenced from multiple files but doesn't exist at that location
   - In `docs/reference/commands.md`, references to:
     - `guides/ai-integration.md` should be `../guides/ai-integration.md`
     - `reference/ai-integration.md` should be `ai-integration.md` or `./ai-integration.md`
     - `reference/mcp-server-implementations.md` should be `mcp-server-implementations.md` or `./mcp-server-implementations.md`

3. **Missing files referenced in `docs/design` documents**:
   - `../reference/task-tags.md` (doesn't exist)
   - `../reference/task-expansion.md` (doesn't exist)
   - `../workflows/create-feature.md` (should be `../ai/workflows/create-feature.md`)
   - `../workflows/bugfix.md` (should be `../ai/workflows/bugfix.md`)
   - `../workflows/audit.md` (should be `../ai/workflows/audit.md`)

## Recommended Fixes

### Fix Path Relativity Issues

1. In `docs/guides/getting-started.md`:
   - Change links to use proper relative paths with `../` prefix for files outside the current directory

2. In `docs/reference/commands.md`:
   - Change links to use proper relative paths with `../` prefix for files outside the current directory
   - Use `./` or no prefix for files in the same directory

### Create Missing Files or Update Links

1. For `../getting-started.md` references:
   - Either create this file at the root of the docs folder, or
   - Update references to point to `docs/guides/getting-started.md`

2. For missing reference files:
   - Either create `docs/reference/task-tags.md` and `docs/reference/task-expansion.md`, or
   - Update references to point to the correct files if they exist elsewhere

3. For workflow files:
   - Update references to point to the correct location (`../ai/workflows/` instead of `../workflows/`)

## Implementation Plan

1. First, fix all path relativity issues with a consistent approach to relative paths
2. Next, create any missing files that are needed
3. Finally, update any references to files that can't or shouldn't be created

This approach will ensure all documentation links are valid and accessible.
