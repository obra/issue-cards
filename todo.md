# Simplified Testing Infrastructure

## Solution Summary

We've successfully fixed the ES module import issues by correctly accessing the exports from the unified and remark packages.

## Key Findings

1. When using CommonJS `require()` with these ES modules:
   - `unified` exports a function as the `unified` property
   - `remark-parse` and `remark-stringify` export their functions as `default` properties

2. The correct import pattern is:
   ```javascript
   const unifiedModule = require('unified');
   const unified = unifiedModule.unified;
   const remarkParseModule = require('remark-parse');
   const remarkParse = remarkParseModule.default;
   const remarkStringifyModule = require('remark-stringify');
   const remarkStringify = remarkStringifyModule.default;
   ```

3. We still need Babel and the Jest `transformIgnorePatterns` configuration to transform the ES modules in node_modules.

## Changes Made

1. Fixed imports in `taskParser.js` to properly access the right exports
2. Simplified the code by removing complex dynamic imports with try/catch blocks
3. Maintained the Babel configuration since it's still required for the tests

## Next Steps

1. We might want to review other parts of the codebase for similar import patterns that could be simplified

## Dependency Analysis

After conducting a binary search through the transformIgnorePatterns configuration, we confirmed that all of the following packages need to be transformed:

- unified - The core processor
- unist - Unified syntax tree utilities
- remark - Markdown processor
- mdast - Markdown abstract syntax tree
- micromark - Markdown parser
- bail - Error handling utility
- trough - Middleware pipeline utility
- vfile - Virtual file system for unified

These packages form a deeply interconnected dependency tree, and all use ESM module syntax which needs to be transformed for Jest's CommonJS environment. We attempted to reduce the list, but found that our tests require the transformation of all these packages.
