## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g issue-cards

# Or use with npx for one-time use
npx issue-cards <command>
```

## Core Commands

### init

Initializes the issue tracking system in your project.

```bash
issue-cards init
```

Creates:
- `.issues/` directory to store all issues and configuration
- Pre-loaded templates for issues and tags
- Directory structure for tracking open and closed issues

Example output:
```
‚úÖ Initialized issue tracking system in .issues/
‚úÖ Created config templates
‚úÖ Ready to create your first issue
```

### create

Creates a new issue from a template.

```bash
issue-cards create <template> --title <title> [options]
```

Arguments:
- `template` - Template type to use (feature, bugfix, refactor, audit)

Required options:
- `--title` - Issue title

Optional sections:
- `--problem` - Description of the problem to solve
- `--approach` - High-level strategy for solving the issue
- `--failed-approaches` - List of approaches already tried (one item per line)
- `--questions` - Questions that need answers (one item per line)
- `--task` - A task to add to the issue (can be specified multiple times), can include #tags
- `--instructions` - Guidelines to follow during implementation
- `--next-steps` - Future work after this issue (one item per line)

Examples:
```bash
# Simple creation with just a title
issue-cards create feature --title "Add search functionality"

# Complete creation with all sections
issue-cards create bugfix \
  --title "Fix login redirect issue" \
  --problem "After login, users are not redirected to the page they were viewing." \
  --approach "Store the original URL in session storage before redirect." \
  --failed-approaches "Tried using URL parameters but it broke for complex URLs." \
  --questions "Should we handle deep linking to protected pages?" \
  --task "Reproduce the issue with a test #unit-test" \
  --task "Add URL storage before login redirect" \
  --task "Implement redirect after successful login" \
  --task "Add error handling for invalid URLs" \
  --instructions "Use sessionStorage rather than localStorage for security." \
  --next-steps "Consider implementing a more robust auth flow."
```

### list

Lists all open issues.

```bash
issue-cards list
```

Example output:
```
Open Issues:
  ‚ö° #0001: Add user authentication (current)
    Current task: Create User model with password field
  
  #0002: Fix password reset email not sending
    Current task: Reproduce the bug with test case
  
  #0003: Refactor API error handling
    Current task: Create consistent error response structure

Total: 3 open issues
```

### show

Shows details of an issue.

```bash
issue-cards show [issue-number]
```

Arguments:
- `issue-number` - Issue number to show (if omitted, shows the current issue)

Example output:
```
# Issue 0001: Add user authentication

## Problem to be solved
Users need to be able to securely log into the application.

## Planned approach
Use JWT tokens with secure cookie storage and implement proper password hashing.

## Failed approaches
- Tried using localStorage for token storage but found security vulnerabilities

## Questions to resolve
- What is the token expiration time?

## Tasks
- [ ] Create user model with password field #unit-test
- [ ] Implement password hashing and verification
- [ ] Create login endpoint #e2e-test
- [ ] Add JWT token generation
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware #unit-test

## Instructions
Follow the project's security guidelines when implementing authentication.
The JWT should include the user's role permissions.

## Next steps
Once authentication is complete, we'll implement:
- Authorization middleware for protected routes
- User profile management
```

### current

Shows the current task with context.

```bash
issue-cards current
```

Example output:
```
CURRENT TASK:
Create user model with password field +unit-test

CONTEXT:

Problem to be solved:
Users need to be able to securely log into the application.

Failed approaches:
- Tried using localStorage for token storage but found security vulnerabilities

Instructions:
Follow the project's security guidelines when implementing authentication.
The JWT should include the user's role permissions.

UPCOMING TASKS:
- Implement password hashing and verification
- Create login endpoint +e2e-test
- Add JWT token generation
- Implement authentication middleware +unit-test

Note: The above upcoming tasks are for context only. Do not work on them until they become the current task.
```

### set-current

Sets a specific issue as the current issue.

```bash
issue-cards set-current <issue-number>
```

Arguments:
- `issue-number` - The issue number to set as current

Example output:
```
‚úÖ Issue #0002 is now current
```

When trying to set a non-existent issue:
```
‚ùå Issue #9999 not found
```

### complete-task

Marks the current task as complete and shows the next task.

```bash
issue-cards complete-task
```

Example output:
```
‚úÖ Completed: Create user model with password field

CURRENT TASK:
Implement password hashing and verification

CONTEXT:

Problem to be solved:
Users need to be able to securely log into the application.

Failed approaches:
- Tried using localStorage for token storage but found security vulnerabilities

Instructions:
Follow the project's security guidelines when implementing authentication.
The JWT should include the user's role permissions.

UPCOMING TASKS:

- Add JWT token generation
- Implement authentication middleware +unit-test

Note: The above upcoming tasks are for context only. Do not work on them until they become the current task.
```

When all tasks are complete:
```
‚úÖ Completed: Implement authentication middleware
üéâ All tasks complete! Issue #0001 has been closed.
